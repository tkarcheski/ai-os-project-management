# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major milestones for the AI Operating System (AI OS) development. The goal is to leverage AI to assist in development and streamline key features of the OS over time.

## Current Focus: Initial Setup and Task Management
- Set up the project repository and configuration.
- Establish a clear project management structure.
- Define workflows for development, testing, and documentation.

## Project Kickoff: Repository Setup and Task Management
- Create a repository structure for managing project tasks and documentation.
- Implement GitHub Projects for tracking issues and milestones.
- Add templates for issues, pull requests, and user stories.

## Phase 2: Core Development
- **AI OS Kernel Development:**
  - Develop task scheduling and resource management components.
  - Implement a basic device driver system for input/output.
  - Set up process isolation and basic security measures.
  
- **AI Engine Development:**
  - Begin initial work on procedural content generation.
  - Integrate AI-assisted task automation to speed up development.

- **Blockchain Layer:**
  - Start the blockchain infrastructure for AI-Tokens and compute credits.
  - Implement initial support for encrypted shard-based storage.

## Phase 3: Feature Development and Integration
- **Advanced AI Integration:**
  - Enhance the AI Engine with machine learning models to assist with decision-making.
  - Develop and test advanced procedural generation systems for content creation.

- **User Interface and API:**
  - Build a basic front-end using React to allow interaction with the AI OS.
  - Develop a GraphQL API to expose core OS features and AI functions.

- **Blockchain and Compute Economy:**
  - Implement smart contracts for managing the AI-Tokens economy.
  - Set up compute resource management and transaction validation.

## Phase 4: Testing, Optimization, and Release
- Perform extensive testing on all components (Kernel, AI Engine, Blockchain, API).
- Optimize performance and ensure system scalability.
- Finalize documentation and prepare for open-source or beta release.
