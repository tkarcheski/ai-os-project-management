# Sprint Planning

The sprint plan is divided into manageable tasks for each phase of the AI OS development. Each sprint will focus on small, achievable goals to ensure steady progress.

## Sprint 1: Repository Setup and Task Management
- Set up GitHub repository and initialize project structure.
- Add necessary files (`README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Create issue templates and labels for bug reports, feature requests, and user stories.
- Configure GitHub Project boards to track milestones and issues.

## Sprint 2: Core System Setup
- **AI OS Kernel:**
  - Begin implementing task scheduling logic.
  - Set up basic resource management (memory, CPU allocation).
  - Build an initial framework for handling input/output through device drivers.

- **AI Engine:**
  - Set up a base for procedural content generation with AI assistance.
  - Develop basic models for automating repetitive tasks (e.g., generating sample data, testing).

## Sprint 3: Security and Blockchain Layer Setup
- **Security:**
  - Implement process isolation and sandboxing to ensure secure task execution.
  - Develop encryption techniques for internal data and communication between processes.

- **Blockchain Layer:**
  - Start creating the blockchain infrastructure for managing AI-Tokens.
  - Design and implement encrypted shard-based storage for secure data distribution.

## Sprint 4: AI Integration and API Development
- **AI Engine:**
  - Expand on procedural content generation with AI models for adaptive content creation.
  - Begin integrating machine learning models for decision-making assistance.

- **API Development:**
  - Create a GraphQL API to expose kernel features and AI functionalities.
  - Ensure API endpoints are secure and support token-based authentication.

## Sprint 5: UI Development and Initial Integration
- **User Interface:**
  - Build a simple front-end using React to allow users to interact with the AI OS.
  - Provide real-time monitoring and control over core OS features via the UI.

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Conduct integration tests between the kernel, AI engine, blockchain, and API.
  - Ensure smooth communication and data transfer between components.

## Sprint 6: Optimization and Finalization
- Perform optimizations on task scheduling and AI-driven processes to improve performance.
- Complete documentation for all modules (Kernel, AI Engine, Blockchain, API).
